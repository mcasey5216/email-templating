# Email Templating

## Original Objectives

- Make a general template that is easy to reuse and responsive
- Create emails in a compiler language
  - Store the copy in variables
  - Read straight from markdown
  - Clarity in readability
  - If statements for conditional formatting
- Consistency and overlap with UIE pages (create/adopt P&SL)

### Step 1 - Standardization
The first step was to create a standard email in plain `HTML` that is responsive w/o media queries.

- sample can be found in `template/template.html` and the inline versions is located at `template/template-inline.html`

The problems that remain with just a plain `HTML` template?

- Code can get dense once customized - difficult to read
- Difficult to reuse customized code - usually easier to start from scratch
- Prone to mistakes
- Manual adjustments for edge cases
- Doesnâ€™t read markdown

### Step 2 - HTML Alternative

Find an alternative to plain `HTML` that is still easy to convert back once its ready to be deployed (specifically through MailChimp).  A proposed solution is to use `Jade`, a clean whitespace-sensitive template language for writing `HTML`.  Benefits of `Jade` include:

- Better readability
- Partials
- Variables
- If statements
- Reading/compiling Markdown

It has the potential to make the code easily reusable, and less prone to mistakes/bugs.

### Step 3 - Practice implementation

Styles are stored in variables, common variables like colors can be stored individually.

    - var textColor = "#333333"
    - var table = "border-spacing:0;font-family:sans-serif;color:" + textColor + ";"
    - var contents = "width:100%;font-size:14px;text-align:left;"

Also multiple variables can be added to the style attribute as if adding multiple classes.  Here is a snippet of how the code lays out.

    tr
      td(style="#{tenpxPadding}")
        table(style="#{table}#{contents}")

The benefit is that there is no external inliner program necessary to provide the format necessary to email templates, yet you still get the necessary convenience of a stylesheet that changes to properties of multiple tags at once.


## Possible Phases

Phase 1: Creating a library of parts

- Two and three column at different ratios, four columns
- Footers, headers, nested
- Separate and customized css libraries
- Create simple documentation on how to create new templates and use existing ones

Phase 2: Convert all our existing templates
- Make and test all of our existing ongoing email templates

	- Podcast
	- TotD
	- AYCL / VS
	- R+E

Phase 3: Minimizing CSS code / steps
- Creating Sass libraries
- Automate CSS inlining

(edit): CSS automation is replaced by styles stored in variables. Sass will probably not be necessary in this track.  4/21/16

Phase 4: Develop an Interface
- Form fields
- Read markdown from a file (not copy/paste)
- Interact with blog post/uie.com to capture information (totd, article)
	- Live updates before email and blog posts
